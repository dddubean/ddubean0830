India is fighting a devastating second wave of Covid-19 that is killing thousands each day as the country recorded more than a million new cases in just three days. Medical facilities have been running out of oxygen and ICU beds, with patients left outside hospitals waiting for care. CNN's Anna Coren reports.
Twitter has removed several tweets about Covid-19 at the request of the Indian government, including some that were critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's handling of a brutal second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.

<p style="margin-top:10px;"><In a statement Sunday, India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said it had asked Twitter (TWTR), Facebook (FB) and others to remove around 100 posts "in view of the misuse of social media platforms by certain users to spread fake or misleading information."</p>
It accused those users of creating "panic" about the latest Covid-19 wave by "using unrelated, old and out of the context images or visuals, communally sensitive posts and misinformation about Covid-19 protocols."
The statement, which included screen grabs of blocked posts from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, said that some of these accounts were urging citizens not to wear a mask, or creating hatred "by inciting religious passions."
